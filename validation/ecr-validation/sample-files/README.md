# Sample eICR Files

The files here were downloaded from the AIMS platform for [EHR Implementers](https://ecr.aimsplatform.org/ehr-implementers/test-package):

- the eICR Test Package, and
- the COVID-19 Samples

## eICR Test Package

These tests seek to confirm that electronic initial case reports (eICRs) generated by electronic health record (EHR) systems are correctly constructed, populated, and conform to the standard specification. The test package instructions outline resources for testing the eICR creation process. These resources apply to both new development and implementation of electronic case reporting (eCR) features within an existing EHR system. Learn more about eICR creation on the [EHR Implementers - eICR Creation, Validation, & Standards](https://ecr.aimsplatform.org/ehr-implementers/eicr-creation-validation-standards/) page.

## COVID-19 Samples

This test package contains sample eICR and RR messages for five COVID-19 scenarios, including HTML and XML files for each. The test files are labeled based on what they would have triggered on â€“ problem/observation, diagnosis, lab order, lab test negative, and lab test positive.
